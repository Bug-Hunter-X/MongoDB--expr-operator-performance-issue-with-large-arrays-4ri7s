```javascript
//Solution 1: Add a field for array size (Best approach)
db.collection.aggregate([
  { 
    $addFields: {
      arraySize: { $size: "$arrayField" }
    }
  },
  { 
    $match: { arraySize: { $gt: 5 } }
  }
]);

//Solution 2: Use a different operator (Not always applicable)
//If you're only concerned with the length of the array, use the $size operator directly in the $match stage instead of $expr
db.collection.find({"arrayField": { $size: {$gt: 5}}});

//Solution 3: Optimize the query (If you must use $expr)
//Break it down into smaller more managable stages.  This is usually not the best approach.
